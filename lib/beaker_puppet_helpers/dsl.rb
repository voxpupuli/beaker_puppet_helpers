    #   @option opts [Boolean] :silent (false) Do not produce log output
    #   @option opts [Array<Fixnum>] :acceptable_exit_codes ([0]) An array
    #     (or range) of integer exit codes that should be considered
    #     acceptable.  An error will be thrown if the exit code does not
    #     match one of the values in this list.

    #     exit codes as passing.
    #   @option opts [Boolean] :dry_run (false) Do not actually execute any
    #     commands on the SUT
    #   @option opts [String] :stdin (nil) Input to be provided during command
    #     execution on the SUT.

    #   @option opts [Boolean] :expect_connection_failure (false) Expect this command
    #     to result in a connection failure, reconnect and continue execution.
    #   @option opts [Hash{String=>String}] :environment ({}) These will be
    #     treated as extra environment variables that should be set before

    # @!macro common_opts
    # @option opts [Boolean]  :parseonly (false) If this key is true, the

    #                         no resource changes during its execution.
    #
    # @option opts [Boolean]  :expect_failures (false) This option enables

    #                         failure during its execution.
    #
    # @option opts [Boolean]  :future_parser (false) This option enables

    #                         from Puppet verion 3.2
    #                         By default it will use the 'current' parser.

    # @option opts [Boolean]  :noop (false) If this option exists, the
    #                         the "--noop" command line parameter will be
    #                         passed to the 'puppet apply' command.

    # @option opts [String]   :modulepath The search path for modules, as

    #                         path separator character. (The POSIX path separator
    #                         is ‘:’, and the Windows path separator is ‘;’.)
    #
    # @option opts [String]   :hiera_config The path of the hiera.yaml configuration.
